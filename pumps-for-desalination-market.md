<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pumps for Desalination Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The desalination market primarily utilizes two types of pumps: centrifugal and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps are favored for their efficiency in moving large volumes of water quickly, making them ideal for high-capacity desalination plants. They rely on rotational energy to create a flow. In contrast, positive displacement pumps are designed to handle thick fluids and provide a constant flow, making them suitable for applications requiring high pressure. Both types play critical roles in ensuring effective and reliable desalination processes.</p></p>
