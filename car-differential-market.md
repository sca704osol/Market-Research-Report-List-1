<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Differential Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Differential</li><li>Limited-Slip Differential</li><li>Locking Differential</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The car differential market includes three main types: Open Differential, Limited-Slip Differential (LSD), and Locking Differential. Open Differential allows wheels to rotate at different speeds, ideal for smooth roads but less effective on uneven terrain. LSD improves traction by distributing power to the wheel with more grip, enhancing performance in slippery conditions. Locking Differential locks both wheels to rotate at the same speed, providing maximum traction for off-road or heavy-duty use, though it can reduce maneuverability on regular roads.</p></p>
