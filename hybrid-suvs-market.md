<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hybrid SUVs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>All Hybrid SUVs</li><li>Plug-in Hybrid SUVs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hybrid SUVs combine a gasoline engine with an electric motor for improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. They recharge their batteries through regenerative braking and the engine, eliminating the need for external charging. Plug-in Hybrid SUVs (PHEVs) also use both gasoline and electric power but feature larger batteries that can be charged externally. PHEVs offer longer electric-only driving ranges compared to standard hybrids, making them ideal for short commutes while retaining the flexibility of a gasoline engine for longer trips. Both types cater to eco-conscious drivers seeking versatility.</p></p>
