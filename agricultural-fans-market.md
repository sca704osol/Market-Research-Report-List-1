<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Fans</li><li>Axial Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agricultural fans market primarily consists of two types: centrifugal fans and axial fans. Centrifugal fans are designed to move air at high pressure, making them ideal for ventilation in large spaces, such as barns and greenhouses. They provide a steady airflow and are effective in maintaining temperature and humidity levels. On the other hand, axial fans move air parallel to the fan shaft, offering high airflow rates suitable for cooling and exhausting air in confined areas. Both types are essential for optimal agricultural operations.</p></p>
