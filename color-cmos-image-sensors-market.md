<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Color CMOS Image Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Global Shutter</li><li>Rolling Shutter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Color CMOS image sensors can be categorized into two main types based on their shutter mechanisms: global shutter and rolling shutter. Global shutter captures all pixels simultaneously, preventing motion distortion and providing high-quality images in dynamic scenes. This is ideal for high-speed applications, such as video recording and industrial automation. In contrast, rolling shutter captures the image line by line, which can lead to artifacts in fast-moving subjects. Rolling shutters are commonly used in consumer applications due to their lower cost and simpler design.</p></p>
