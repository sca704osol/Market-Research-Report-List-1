<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Hydraulic System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Center</li><li>Closed-Center</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aircraft hydraulic system market is primarily divided into two types: open-center and closed-center systems. Open-center systems maintain a continuous flow of hydraulic fluid, allowing multiple actuators to operate simultaneously, making them simpler and lighter, but less efficient. In contrast, closed-center systems circulate fluid only when an actuator is engaged, optimizing efficiency and pressure maintenance, but adding complexity and weight. Both types cater to different aircraft designs and operational requirements, influencing overall performance and reliability.</p></p>
