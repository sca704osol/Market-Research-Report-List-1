<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Perforators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thin Bone Area</li><li>Thick Bone Area</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cranial perforators are specialized tools used in neurosurgery for accessing the brain through the skull. The market is segmented into two main types based on bone thickness: thin bone areas and thick bone areas. Thin bone area perforators are designed for use in regions where the skull is less dense, facilitating easier penetration. Conversely, thick bone area perforators are engineered to handle denser skull regions, ensuring effective drilling and minimizing trauma during surgical procedures. Both types are crucial for optimizing surgical outcomes.</p></p>
